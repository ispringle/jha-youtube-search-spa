    description:
      "Long story short, here is one clip each of every single truck that I've filmed (during daylight hours) from August of 2015 through May of 2017, over 135 different trucks in total! Many have been seen before, many will be featured in future uploads, and a few will only ever be seen here! For the dedicated, avid refuse truck enthusiast, grab some popcorn, kick back, and feast your eyes upon this wild assortment of waste collection equipment! Or maybe you don't have time to take in the full 75 minutes all at once? Have no fear! I have broken this mega-compilation up into 5 easily digestible 15-minute segments! Throughout this video, you will find a diverse variety of side loaders, rear loaders, front loaders, and recycling trucks! The oldest truck featured dates back to the 1970's, while the newest truck was only weeks old at the time of filming! There should absolutely be something for everyone here, and I tried very hard to keep it equally exciting from start to finish! I put an absolutely absurd amount of work into this, so be sure and drop me a comment and let me know which trucks were your favorite!\n\nAs a final thought, I would like to extend the hugest of thank yous to everyone who made all of these filming adventures possible! To all of the dedicated, courteous, and professional drivers seen here doing their jobs, and to all of the fellow refuse truck enthusiasts that accompanied me on these adventures and helped make so many of them possible, thank you!\n\nThere is still so much more to come, so stay tuned!\n\nThrash 'N' Trash Productions...Wasting Away Through Garbage Trucks and Heavy Metal Since 2008\n\nFor more videos: http://www.youtube.com/TrashMonkey22\nFor more photos: http://www.flickr.com/deathmetal22\nFor my latest musings: http://www.facebook.com/ThrashNTrashP...\nFor my garbage truck blog: http://wastedwashington.blogspot.com/\nFor refuse industry history: http://www.classicrefusetrucks.com/\n\nThanks for Watching!\n\n©2017 Thrash 'N' Trash Productions.

      title: "Garbage Trucks: The Ultimate Compilation",
      description:
        "Long story short, here is one clip each of every single truck that I've filmed (during daylight hours) from August of 2015 through May of 2017, over 135 different trucks in total! Many have been seen before, many will be featured in future uploads, and a few will only ever be seen here! For the dedicated, avid refuse truck enthusiast, grab some popcorn, kick back, and feast your eyes upon this wild assortment of waste collection equipment! Or maybe you don't have time to take in the full 75 minutes all at once? Have no fear! I have broken this mega-compilation up into 5 easily digestible 15-minute segments! Throughout this video, you will find a diverse variety of side loaders, rear loaders, front loaders, and recycling trucks! The oldest truck featured dates back to the 1970's, while the newest truck was only weeks old at the time of filming! There should absolutely be something for everyone here, and I tried very hard to keep it equally exciting from start to finish! I put an absolutely absurd amount of work into this, so be sure and drop me a comment and let me know which trucks were your favorite!\n\nAs a final thought, I would like to extend the hugest of thank yous to everyone who made all of these filming adventures possible! To all of the dedicated, courteous, and professional drivers seen here doing their jobs, and to all of the fellow refuse truck enthusiasts that accompanied me on these adventures and helped make so many of them possible, thank you!\n\nThere is still so much more to come, so stay tuned!\n\nThrash 'N' Trash Productions...Wasting Away Through Garbage Trucks and Heavy Metal Since 2008\n\nFor more videos: http://www.youtube.com/TrashMonkey22\nFor more photos: http://www.flickr.com/deathmetal22\nFor my latest musings: http://www.facebook.com/ThrashNTrashP...\nFor my garbage truck blog: http://wastedwashington.blogspot.com/\nFor refuse industry history: http://www.classicrefusetrucks.com/\n\nThanks for Watching!\n\n©2017 Thrash 'N' Trash Productions.
